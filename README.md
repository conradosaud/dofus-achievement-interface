# Dofus Achievement Interface
The inferface of Dofus Achievements (like ingame), made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
*The code is originally written in Portuguese.*

This is a fully modifiable file, very simple and easy to use, since you only need to add more content within the HTML.

You can find all achievements images from Dofus in the installation folder, generally in the path:   `C:\Users\your-user\AppData\Local\Ankama\zaap\dofus\content\gfx\achievements`
